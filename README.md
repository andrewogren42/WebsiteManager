This app I made so that my Grandma would be able to manage her website https://www.scentsofhope.net/ herself and would not
have to pay wix for a website she did not get much use out of anyways. So far I have made three tabs for this up the first
is Messages. 

Messsages Tab:
  what this does is it watches the database for any new messages that the website adds and displays them. When
you click on a message a bottom sheet shows a detailed view of everything and there is a delete button to delete the message 
from the database after your done. 
Orders Tab:
  This tab takes the information like name and address from paypal
when someone checks out and adds it to the database just like with the messages. The app watches for new orders the same way
and also has a bottom sheet detailed view with a delete button at the bottom. 
Listings Tab:
  There are three options on this tab Add, Edit, and Delete after selecting one a bottom sheet will open with a form to enter all the information needed
and to select and photo from the photos app which is then added to the datbase and storage for the picture. The database IDs are
just the listings names lowercased and removing spaces so its easy to find when you want to edit.

The file organization is not the best at the moment in some places, but I will be fixing that shortly to move to a MVVM architechure.
